Beat around the bush
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice
Burn the midnight oil
Caught between two stools
Cost an arm and a leg
Cry over spilt milk
Curiosity killed the cat
Cut the mustard
Drastic times call for drastic measures
Every cloud has a silver lining
Far cry from
Feel a bit under the weather
Give the benefit of the doubt
Hear it on the grapevine
Hit the road
In the heat of the moment
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Kill two birds with one stone
