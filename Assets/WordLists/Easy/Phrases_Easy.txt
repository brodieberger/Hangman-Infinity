Time flies
Break a leg
Piece of cake
Hit the books
Let the cat out of the bag
Hit the nail on the head
When pigs fly
Bite the bullet
The best of both worlds
Speak of the devil
Cutting corners
Playing devil's advocate
To add insult to injury
Your guess is as good as mine
A blessing in disguise
Call it a day
Go back to the drawing board
Hit the sack
Miss the boat
Under the weather
