Let the cat out of the bag
Method to my madness
Not playing with a full deck
Off one's rocker
Once in a blue moon
Picture paints a thousand words
Piece of cake
See eye to eye
Sit on the fence
Speak of the devil
Steal someone's thunder
Take with a grain of salt
Taste of your own medicine
Throw in the towel
Turn a blind eye
Up in the air
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wrap your head around it
You can't judge a book by its cover
Your guess is as good as mine
